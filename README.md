# bellis

*bellus* — pretty | *perennis* — everlasting

day's eye opens at dawn, closes at dusk.

war makes states. states make war.
extraction builds empires.

roots in bare metal.
fabric woven through virtual leaves.
every packet marked, every flow traced.
edges hold. layers breathe.

perennial by design.
