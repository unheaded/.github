# unheaded bellicists

*bellus* — pretty | *perennis* — everlasting

Day's eye opens at dawn, daisy closes at dusk.

war makes states. states make war.
extinction builds headless empires.

roots in bare metal.
fabric woven through virtual leaves.
every packet marked, every flow traced.
edges hold. layers breathe.

perennial by design.
